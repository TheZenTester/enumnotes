# README.md
Tool to act as a repository for all of my shortcuts and notes.  This project is in its infancy, but for now the idea is to migrate the data I have in Joplin (shoutout to @tjnull for https://github.com/tjnull/TJ-JPT), but have tailored based on developing my methodologies over time.  This tool might not be for you, but hopefully will give you a framework in which you can make it your own by forking and copypasta-ing your own commands you use most.

# Enhancements
- Have a command to run which will print out shortcuts for various stages of network pentest
- Have output print out in markdown format (i.e. glow , batcat)
